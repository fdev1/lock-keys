lock-keys
=========

A GTK+ based utility that displays a caps lock indicator on the system tray and (optionally) on screen whenever the state of the capslock key changes.

How to install
--------------

make
make install

Run lock-keys from a DE session to start. On KDE you can click on the tray icon and set the autostart option on the settings dialog, on other desktops you may have to configure autostart manually.

By default it installs to /usr/local/bin but you can modify the Makefile to select a different location.

How to uninstall
----------------

make uninstall
